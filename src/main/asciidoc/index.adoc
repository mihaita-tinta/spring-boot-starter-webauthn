[[resources-registration-start]]
== Register new user

By default, new user registration is disabled.

==== Disabled new user registration

include::{snippets}/registration-start-new-user-disabled/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/registration-start-new-user-disabled/http-response.adoc[]
If you want to allow it, you need to explicitly activate it: `webauthn.registrationNewUsers.enabled=true`

When _true_, a `POST` request is used to start the Add User ceremony. *A new user is created* on the Relying Party side based on the provided signup information.

==== Request structure

=== Anonymous users

If `webauthn.usernameRequired=false` is specified in your configuration properties, one can (optionally) enter only their firstName/lastName.

[[resources-registration-finish-post]]
=== Registration finish

A `POST` request is used to finish the Add User ceremony. Based on the `registrationId` value generated in the first step, we associate new strong credentials to the created user.

==== Request structure

==== Example response
As a result we receive a `recoveryToken`
